I'm poor as hell and can't afford a cellphone to install nethunter.

Therefore I'm trying to make Rootless Nethunter more usefull by creating extra-keys on termux with stored commands
to run quick hack stuffs, like, crafting payloads, simple http servers, automated recon and stuff. 

Installation:


~~~
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/kanedasec/fuktermux.git
~~~
